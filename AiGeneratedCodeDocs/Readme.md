These imports allow the application to use the functionalities provided by the imported namespaces and make the necessary types available for use in the application's components and pages.
## App

The `App` component is the entry point of the application. It is responsible for setting up the routing configuration and rendering the appropriate components based on the current URL.

The `Router` component is used to define the routing configuration for the application. It takes an `AppAssembly` parameter, which specifies the assembly that contains the application's components. This allows the router to discover and match routes to the corresponding components.

Inside the `Router` component, there are two main sections: `Found` and `NotFound`. 

The `Found` section is used to render the component associated with the matched route. It takes a `Context` parameter, which provides information about the current route. The `RouteView` component is used to render the component that corresponds to the current route. It takes the `RouteData` parameter, which contains information about the current route, and the `DefaultLayout` parameter, which specifies the layout component to use for rendering the route component.

The `NotFound` section is used to render a fallback component when no route matches the current URL. It uses the `LayoutView` component to specify the layout component to use, and renders a simple message indicating that there is nothing at the current address.

Overall, the `App` component sets up the routing configuration and handles rendering the appropriate components based on the current URL. It provides a way to navigate between different pages and ensures that the correct components are displayed based on the current route.
## AppState

The `AppState` class is responsible for managing the state of the application. It implements the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface, which allows it to notify subscribers when a property value changes.

### Properties

- `UserDataFolder`: A string property that represents the path to the user data folder. When the value of this property changes, the `OnPropertyChanged` method is called to notify subscribers.
- `HasLoggedOut`: A boolean property that indicates whether the user has logged out.
- `ActiveApp`: An `AppSettings` object that represents the active application settings. When the value of this property changes, the `OnPropertyChanged` method is called to notify subscribers.
- `UserData`: A `UserData` object that represents the user data. When the value of this property changes, the `OnPropertyChanged` method is called to notify subscribers.
- `Theme`: A string property that represents the current theme of the application. When the value of this property changes, the `OnPropertyChanged` method is called to notify subscribers.
- `BaseRepoPath`: A string property that represents the base repository path. When the value of this property changes, the `OnPropertyChanged` method is called to notify subscribers.
- `IsGpt4`: A boolean property that indicates whether the application is using GPT-4.

### Methods

- `SaveUser()`: This method serializes the `UserData` object to JSON and saves it to a file in the user data folder.
- `LoadUser()`: This method loads the user data from a JSON file in the user data folder and updates the `UserData` and `Theme` properties.
- `OnPropertyChanged(string propertyName)`: This method is called when a property value changes. It invokes the `PropertyChanged` event and passes the name of the property that changed as an argument.

## DocGenerator

The `DocGenerator` component is responsible for generating documentation for code files in a selected directory. It provides a user interface for selecting the directory and specifying the output location for the generated documentation.

The component uses the Radzen UI components to create the user interface. It consists of two main sections: the directory selection section and the documentation generation section.

In the directory selection section, the component allows the user to input the path to the directory containing the code files. If the directory path is not provided, a form is displayed where the user can enter the path. Once a valid directory path is provided, the component retrieves the list of directories and files in the selected directory and displays them in a tree structure using the RadzenTree component. The user can expand the tree nodes to view the subdirectories and files.

In the documentation generation section, the component allows the user to specify the output directory for the generated documentation. If the user chooses not to use the selected directory as the output directory, they can enter a different output directory path. The component also displays a checkbox that allows the user to use the selected directory as the output directory.

Once the user selects the directory and specifies the output directory, they can click the "Generate Doc" button to start the documentation generation process. The component retrieves the code files in the selected directory and its subdirectories, and generates Markdown documentation for each file. The generated documentation is displayed in a RadzenCard component. The component also keeps track of the total number of input tokens used for generating the documentation.

The component provides a button to open the generated documentation file in a Markdown viewer, such as Visual Studio Code.

Overall, the `DocGenerator` component provides a user-friendly interface for generating documentation for code files in a selected directory. It uses the Radzen UI components to create the user interface and MarkdownSharp library to convert the code files into Markdown documentation.
## SettingsDialog

The `SettingsDialog` component is responsible for displaying a form that allows the user to configure the settings for an application. It uses the Radzen UI components to create the user interface.

The component consists of a `RadzenCard` component that contains a `RadzenTemplateForm`. The `RadzenTemplateForm` is bound to a `AppSettings` object named `_settingsForm`, which represents the current settings for the application.

Inside the `RadzenTemplateForm`, there are several `RadzenRow` and `RadzenColumn` components that define the layout of the form. Each `RadzenColumn` contains a `RadzenFormField` component that represents a form field.

The form fields include:
- `RadzenTextBox`: Used to input the application name and repository path.
- `RadzenDropDown`: Used to select the programming languages used in the application.
- `RadzenTextBox`: Used to input the framework description of the application.
- `RadzenTextArea`: Used to input the technical details and domain description of the application.

Each form field is bound to the corresponding property of the `_settingsForm` object using the `@bind-Value` directive.

The `RadzenRequiredValidator` components are used to validate the form fields and display error messages if the fields are empty. The `Popup` property is set to `true` to display the error messages as popups.

The `RadzenButton` component is used to submit the form. When the form is submitted, the `Submit` method is called. In the `Submit` method, the `appSettings` parameter is passed, and the `AppState.ActiveApp` property is set to the submitted settings. If the submitted settings already exist in the `AppState.UserData.Apps` list, the existing settings are updated. Otherwise, the new settings are added to the list. The `AppState.SaveUser` method is called to save the updated user data. Finally, the `DialogService.Close` method is called to close the dialog.

Below the label, there is a `<div>` element with a class of "select" that represents the select dropdown. It contains a `<select>` element that represents the dropdown menu.

Inside the `<select>` element, there is an optional `<option>` element that is displayed when no item is selected. It displays the label text followed by ellipsis.

Following the `<option>` element, there is a loop that iterates over the `_optionPairs` dictionary, which contains the options in the dropdown menu. For each key-value pair in the dictionary, an `<option>` element is generated with the value set to the key and the display name set to the value of the specified property in the item.

Finally, there is a `<span>` element with a class of "focus" that represents the focus indicator of the dropdown menu.

### Methods

- `OnParametersSetAsync()`: This method is called when the component's parameters are set. It initializes the `_optionPairs` dictionary with the options from the `OptionsList` parameter. If a `SelectedValue` is provided, it is added as the first item in the dictionary. The display name for each item is obtained by calling the `GetStringPropValue` extension method on the item, passing the `DisplayPropertyName` parameter as the property name.

- `SelectionChanged(ChangeEventArgs args)`: This method is called when an item in the dropdown menu is selected. It updates the `SelectedValue` property based on the selected item from the `_optionPairs` dictionary. It then triggers the `OnSelectItem` and `SelectedValueChanged` event callbacks with the selected item as a parameter.

### Extension Method

The `GetStringPropValue` extension method is a static method that takes an item and a property name as input and returns the string value of the specified property in the item. It uses reflection to retrieve the property value from the item.

The `MySelect` component provides a customizable select dropdown with options in the AiGeneratedCodeDocs application. It allows the user to select an item from the dropdown menu and triggers event callbacks when an item is selected or the selected value changes.
## Tooltip

The `Tooltip` component is a reusable Blazor component that represents a tooltip. It displays additional information when the user hovers over an element.

### Usage

To use the `Tooltip` component, you need to provide the following parameters:

- `ChildContent`: A parameter of type `RenderFragment` that represents the content of the tooltip. It is the content that will be displayed when the user hovers over the element.
- `Text`: A parameter of type `string` that represents the text to be displayed in the tooltip.
- `Css`: A parameter of type `string` that specifies the position of the tooltip relative to the element. It is set to a default value of "right".

### Component Structure

The `Tooltip` component consists of a `<div>` element with a class of "tooltip-wrapper" that serves as the container for the tooltip.

Inside the `<div>` element, there is another `<div>` element with a class of "tooltip-content-@Css" that represents the tooltip content. It displays the text provided in the `Text` parameter.

Below the content, there is the `ChildContent` parameter, which represents the content that will trigger the tooltip when the user hovers over it.

### Properties

- `ChildContent`: A property of type `RenderFragment` that represents the content of the tooltip. It is set using the `Parameter` attribute.
- `Text`: A property of type `string` that represents the text to be displayed in the tooltip. It is set using the `Parameter` attribute.
- `Css`: A property of type `string` that specifies the position of the tooltip relative to the element. It is set to a default value of "right" using the `Parameter` attribute.

The `Tooltip` component provides a reusable tooltip functionality in the AiGeneratedCodeDocs application. It allows for easy display of additional information when the user hovers over an element. The position of the tooltip can be customized using the `Css` parameter.
## Startup

The `Startup` class is responsible for configuring the services and dependencies used in the AiGeneratedCodeDocs application. It sets up the application's host, configures the services, and initializes the necessary dependencies.

### Init Method

The `Init` method is a static method that initializes the application. It creates a default host builder using `Host.CreateDefaultBuilder()`, configures the services using the `WireupServices` method, and builds the host. The `Services` property is then set to the services provided by the host.

### WireupServices Method

The `WireupServices` method is a private method that configures the services used in the application. It takes a `HostBuilderContext` and an `IServiceCollection` as parameters.

Inside the method, the following services are configured:

- `AddWindowsFormsBlazorWebView()`: This service configures the Windows Forms Blazor WebView, which allows the application to host Blazor components within a Windows Forms application.

- `HttpClient`: This service configures an instance of `HttpClient` to be used for making HTTP requests. The `Timeout` property of the `HttpClient` is set to 10 minutes.

- `AddOpenAIDotNet()`: This service configures the OpenAIDotNet library, which provides access to the OpenAI API. The API key and organization ID are retrieved from the application's configuration settings.

- `CreateDocumentService`: This service configures an instance of the `CreateDocumentService` class, which is responsible for generating Markdown documents from code.

- `ILoggerFactory`: This service configures an instance of the `ILoggerFactory` interface using the Serilog.Extensions.Logging.SerilogLoggerFactory implementation. This allows for logging in the application using the Serilog logging library.

- `AddBlazorWebViewDeveloperTools()`: This service is only added in the DEBUG configuration. It configures the Blazor WebView developer tools, which provide additional debugging capabilities for Blazor components.

Overall, the `Startup` class sets up the services and dependencies used in the AiGeneratedCodeDocs application. It configures the Blazor WebView, HTTP client, OpenAI integration, logging, and other necessary services.
